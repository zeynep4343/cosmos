he Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications. CometBFT (BFT Consensus) and the Cosmos SDK are written in the Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build Gaia, the implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

WARNING: The Cosmos SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some breaking changes.

Note: Requires Go 1.20+
